1. Did you attempt to make your computer player very smart -- i.e., do something more clever
than just pick a random legal move?

Yes, I made my computer player more clever than just pick a random legal move.

2. If so, were you able to accomplish this? Is your computer player as smart as you would like?

Yes, I accomplished this and it is as smart as I would like.

3. How did you determine which piece to play next? Tell us about your “pick next move” algorithm

My AI would caculate the maximum number of tiles that it could flip in those valid moves, and
then pick that most "valuable position" as next move.

4. How often did your computer program beat you, or your friends, or whoever tested it out for you?

Ninety percent of time that I would lose the game.

5. How would you improve it in the future?

I would like to scan the corners of the board first, if there has any legal move, lay down a tile on it.
Else apply my current strategies.
